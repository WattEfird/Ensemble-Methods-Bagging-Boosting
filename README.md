# Bagging_Boosting

Used ensemble methods by building models to predict whether applicants for visa certification would be approved or denied.<break/>
I used bagging as well as boosting models. Performed hyperparameter tuning on each model and then I then found their accuracy, precision, recall and F1 scores.</break>
After performance was found on all models,  I used stacking on boosting models before determining which model performed best.
